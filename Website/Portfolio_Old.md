# Isadora Campregher Paiva's Projects Portfolio

This is a selection of some of the data science projects I have made independently to showcase what I can do. Because I often use interactive graphs which don't display well on GitHub, for Python projects the links are directly to the Google Colab files and for the single R project the link downloads the html file written in R Markdown.

## Project 1: [Netflix Data](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Lh2XwVI1APUyH2GrnYXiYn5S0jifPGhI)
This project was undertaken for the R for Data Science Advanced course at [TechAcademy](https://www.tech-academy.io/einblicke/) in 2022/2023. We were supposed to follow a [Project Guide](https://github.com/CamPaiva/netflix-data/raw/main/Project%20Guide%20-%20Leitfaden.pdf) indicating the tasks we had to accomplish. The project used two datasets: a [general one from from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) and one with one's personal data from Netflix, which anyone can request. The first portion is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualization; the second to the creation of a content-based recommendation system. 

## Project 2: [Sight&Sound's Greatest Films of All Time](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KljzCTf7Mo0_7No1yGuoiib_ZEarpV3L?usp=sharing)
A comparison of Sight&Sound's Greatest Films of All Time [2012](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics) and [2022](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/revealed-results-2022-sight-sound-greatest-films-all-time-poll) lists using Python. This was a personal project done for the fun of it. I compiled the data myself using the Sight & Sound lists and adding data from Wikidata and OMDb (this was done with OpenRefine). What you see here are the visualizations I did from the resulting data, comparing for instance the percentage of films directed by women in the two lists, the directors with the most films on each list, the most represented countries, etc.

## Project 3: [Airbnb Amsterdam](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1daXRFlrR8RO7KsHTf3IsQvtnNbpLHRL6?usp=sharing)
This project was undertaken for the Python for Data Science Advanced course at [TechAcademy](https://www.tech-academy.io/einblicke/) in 2021/2022. 
We were supposed to follow a [Project Guide](https://github.com/CamPaiva/airbnb-amsterdam/raw/main/Airbnb_ProjectGuide_TechAcademy.pdf) indicating the tasks we had to accomplish. The project used data from Airbnb, and each individual had to work on a specific city. Mine was Amsterdam. The first portion is dedicated to exploratory data analysis and visualization, and the second to a price prediction model using machine learning.

## Project 4: [Goethe University's Film Reference List](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Nqhzj402PM-oyMxY7m7AzHKfuklhfD3r?usp=sharing)
The film department of the Goethe University Frankfurt makes a [Reference List](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/83387917/ReferenzlisteFilm_Nov2019.pdf) available to its students, which I cleaned up and enriched (using OpenRefine) and then analyzed here using Python. I tackle, for instance, what countries are the most represented and what percentage of films were directed by women. This was originally a personal project, which later morphed into a successful intervention to update the list.
